# mukhan-Feelsbook

The FeelsBook app enables users to keep track of the emotions that they experience across time. Emotions can be entered with an associated comment, and are timestamped.
If users desire to modify their entry, they are able to change the date, the emotional state, and comment for that emotion, or delete the entire entry.
The app further provides a wholistic overview of the totals of each emotion experienced.
